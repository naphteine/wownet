		<h3>Welcome to IRC (Internet Relay Chat) detailed article.</h3>

		IRC is used for a long time. Because it's simple, almost every machine capable to run.<br>
		IRC is being 2 parts: Server and client.<br>
		Server is main place where every connection comes and goes others.<br>
		Client is connections which connected to server.<br>
		<br>
		For accessing our IRC service, you can use:<br>
		- irssi / A good irc client software.<br>
			How to use: download and run with irssi command, /connect 192.168.2.106, /join #chitchat.<br>
		<br>
		- Other client softwares<br>
			How to use:<br>
				When it asks for IP: 192.168.2.106 should be enough.<br>
				When it asks for channel: #chitchat should be enough.<br>
		<br>
			Some of them not ask you directly and wait you to make request. For them Internet and search
			engines your only chance for now.</p>
