This repository contains all efforts I did to create an image sharing website that run on one of my local lab machines in 2014. For this project's stack I first used Ubuntu Server, then converted to FreeBSD. For web server I started with Apache and converted to nginx. All programming done on PHP (sob)

## Warning

I didn't fix any problems and deprecated features in the code. So if you plan to use it, I suggest to use it as a reference. Copy whatever part you want and change it as you see fit.
